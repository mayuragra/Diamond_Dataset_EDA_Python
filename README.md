## Introduction

The csv dataset contains 50.000 observation, that describes diamonds using 10 different variables, such as the cut, the carat, the depth, the color, the clarity and the price. The project starts first with an exploratory data analysis to spot the relationships in data.

## Data Dictionary

-price: Price in US dollars (18,823)
-carat: Weight of the diamond (0.2 – 5.01)
-cut: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
-color: Diamond colour, from D (best) to J (worst)
-clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
-x: Length in mm (0 – 10.74)
-y: Width in mm (0 – 58.9)
-z: Depth in mm (0 – 31.8)
-depth: Total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43–79)
-table: Width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43–95)
